# ZeroWaste – Prevent Food Wastage

ZeroWaste is a full-stack web application designed during a Hackathon under the theme **"Prevent Wastage of Food"**.  
The goal of the project is to create a sustainable platform where **restaurants, individuals, and event organizers** can donate surplus food, and **NGOs, food banks, and charities** can easily access it.  

By leveraging technology, ZeroWaste connects donors with receivers to reduce food waste and fight hunger.

## Problem Statement
Food wastage is a **global challenge**, with millions of tons of edible food thrown away every year, while at the same time, millions of people face hunger daily.  
Most often, the food goes to waste due to:  
- Lack of awareness of nearby NGOs or charities.  
- No proper communication platform between donors and receivers.  
- Limited visibility of available food at the right time.  

---

## Our Solution
ZeroWaste acts as a **bridge between donors and receivers** by:  
- Allowing donors to **upload details of surplus food** (type, quantity, expiry/validity).  
- Using **location mapping (Leaflet.js)** to show nearby donation points.  
- Providing receivers (NGOs/charities) with **real-time access** to available food.  
- Encouraging a **community-driven approach** to reduce food wastage.
